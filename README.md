# Computational Logic
This is a repository for all the programs proposed in Logical Computation Class.
## Credits
Optilog Developer: The investigation team of [UDL](https://www.eps.udl.cat/ca/) directed by [Carlos Ansótegui](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=Pisfb3EAAAAJ&hl=en)

Developer of sudoku.py: Student: Èric Bitriá Ribes
## Objectives
The main objective is having an archive of all the progress during the developtment of the programs.
### Sudoku.py

The objective of this project is creating a Sudoku solver based on the computational logic using python. This project uses [Optilog](http://hardlog.udl.cat/static/doc/optilog/html/index.html) A framework for SAT-Based Systems. The program constructs all the necessary logic clauses so Optilog is able to identify them and generate a solution.

### Tools

This project also includes tools, such as tests and the already compiled sudoku.bin, these tools are only used for testing and are not included in the final project.
